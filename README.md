# Javascript 30 â€“ My Progress
I've been working through Wes Bos's Javascript 30 exercises whenever I get the chance. These are my results.

## 001 The Drum Kit
My version is an intergalactic soundboard with lasers and photon torpedoes.
I'd love to take this further and go all out, making the interior cockpit of a ship with stars flying by.

## 002 The Clock
I really want to take this exercise and rework it into one of those old cat clocks from the 80s with the shifty eyes and swishing tail.

## 003 CSS Variables

## 004 Array Practice

## 005 A Flexbox + JS Image Gallery

## 006 Type Ahead

## 007 Array Cardio Day 2

## 008 HTML 5 Canvas

## 009 Chrome DevTools
Learning about console.table was a hit, along with using CSS to style text within the console.

## 010 Hold shift to check multiple boxes
Built this out with some awesome custom checkboxes and the ability to click anywhere on the list item to trigger a check.

## 011 A Custom HTML5 Video Player

## 012 Konami Code

## 013 Slide in on Scroll
I put a lot of extra work into this one! Love what I learned about using JS to trigger functions based on scroll position. I combined this with a JS library called "Splitting" by @shshaw which allows the animation of individual characters of text.
